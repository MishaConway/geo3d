# Geo3d

Library for common 3d graphics vector and matrix operations

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'geo3d'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install geo3d

## Usage
```
a = Geo3d::Vector.point 1, 0, 0
b = Geo3d::Vector.point 0, 1, 0
sum = a + b # add them together
sum *= 2 #double the vector

m = Geo3d::Matrix.translation 0, 5, 0, #create a translation matrix that transforms a points 5 units on the y-axis
sum = m * sum #apply the transform to our vector
```


## Vector

Describes a three dimensional point or direction. A vector has the following read/write attributes: x, y, z, w

Constructors
```
    a = Geo3d::Vector.new #all attributes are initialized to zero
    b = Geo3d::Vector.new x,y,z,w  #initialize all attributes directly
    c = Geo3d::Vector.new x,y,z   #initialize x,y, and z directly and default w to zero
    d = Geo3d::Vector.point x,y,z  #initialize x,y, and z directly and default w to one
    e = Geo3d::Vector.direction x,y,z  #initialize x,y, and z directly and default w to zero
```
